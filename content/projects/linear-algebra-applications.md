# 📐 Linear-algebra-applications
> A program designed exclusively for a college linear algebra class

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a code that receives a vector from the Cartesian plane (2 coordinates), receives a
rotation angle and rotate the vector by the given angle.
<br>The code should:
- Receive the vector element by element.
- Receive rotation angle.
- Confirm with the user whether the given angle is clockwise or counterclockwise.
- Apply the requested rotation.
- Print the resulting vector of the applied rotation.
 
Write a code that receives, element by element, two matrices A and B (with free dimensions),
multiplies the matrices and prints the result (product).
<br>The code should:
- Ask the number of rows and columns of each matrix and store.
- Check and notify if the product exists, requesting changes when necessary.
- Ask the user to inform all the elements (1 to 1) of each matrix.
- Store these elements in matrices A and B.
- Do the multiplication and save in a matrix C.
- Print the result (C matrix).
