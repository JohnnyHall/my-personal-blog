# 💼 Sistema Trabalhista
> Technology in favor of the visually impaired is still a very small market, there are few works that focus on proposing technological solutions to improve accessibility based on the difficulties encountered by this population, which reinforces the importance of this research to promote discussion of the subject. More than 6 million Brazilians face difficult mobility problems caused by precarious locomotion structures, lack of planning and inclusion for the visually impaired. Faced with this, with a growing concern about the safety of the visually impaired during their locomotion, this work evaluated the feasibility of developing a device that works as a guide, seeing nearby objects through sensors and warning through vibrations and audible feedback, it has a mobile application responsible for registering users and managing them, thus respectively informing their appropriate information, informing the best routes for the disabled, sending requests for help with their current location if necessary. The TCC process was delimited by the engineering methodology, with identification of the problem, hypotheses and objectives and by the survey of bibliographical references.

## 🎯 Objective

- I was responsible for helping in the development of the application that was made in flutter and then creating the APIs in django rest framework.
